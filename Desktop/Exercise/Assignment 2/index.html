<main>
    <p>Welcome to MyFinance, a web application which allows you to view your recent transactions, view your monthly projected spending
        based on your recent transactions, view and edit your profile, and more.</p>
    <h1>Profile Editor</h1>
    <p>Located on the login page, you will be able to change your credit/debit card numbers, change your preferred name, and change
        things like time between each paycheck to help predict how much you can spend.</p>
    <h2>Transaction History</h2>
    <p>This page contains a list of your recent transactions for each card you've entered. This includes
        purchase date, purchase location, and purchase amount for every transaction. It also contains your current account balance
        and allows you to change it on command to resemble a predicted increase or decrease. It also logs your total amount spent
        for your chosen time period.</p>
    <h3>Spending Prediction</h3>
    <p>The spending prediction model tells you how much you will spend by the end of your time period if you continue on the same
        rate of spending. If this happens to be higher than your current budget, we will show you the maximum amount you can spend
        per day/week in order to not exceed your budget.</p>
